dart online coding tool : https://dartpad.dev/?

every flutter app is a bunch of widgets

class Person{
    String? name; // optional variable
    int age;

    Person({@required String name,int age=20}){// named arguments
    // here 20 is default value
    // @required noted that is mandatory
    // @required not built in dart it is flutter feature
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
}

every widget is a dart object

statefull widget got re render when internal change happens and also from external changes
stateless wwidget got re render only from external change


flutter does not redraw entire screen pixel when the app state changes it has very advance mechanism for identify what are need to re draw of widget tree
